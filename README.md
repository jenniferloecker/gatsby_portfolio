# Gatsby Starter Fresh

A starter blog skeleton using the Fresh Theme for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/). The starter is created from my own [personal website](https://mishal23.github.io/) originally inspired from the [Fresh theme](https://github.com/artemsheludko/fresh). The project aims to provide minimal base for building a user-friendly and fast blogging site for anyone.

## Features

- Built with GatsbyJS
- Blazing fast loading time
- Mobile Friendly
- High quality code (A)
- Component seperated code
- Custom 404 page
- Markdown support for new posts
- Code syntax highlighting
- Supports PWA
- Social Media icons
- Google Analytics

## ðŸš€ Quick start

- Install this starter locally (assuming you have GatsbyJS installed)

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-starter-fresh https://github.com/mishal23/gatsby-starter-fresh
```

- Start developing by navigating in your site directory and start it up

```bash
cd gatsby-starter-fresh/
gatsby develop
```

The site would be running live on `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `gatsby-starter-fresh` directory in a code editor of your choice and edit `gatsby-config.js` with your details:

- Name
- Description
- Keywords
- Social media usernames (github, email, linkedin)
- `trackingID` at `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics` plugin

Feel free to create new posts in the `src/posts` directory. The changes will be reflected in real-time on your browser.

## Contributing
