It is made used Gatsby, React, and deployed with Netlify. I used a Gatsby starter project called gatsby-starter-fresh which helped with the styling of the project. The projects are side projects I've created in other repositories and turned into Gatsby pages for the portfolio. Netlify is super easy to use to deploy with Gatsby.
