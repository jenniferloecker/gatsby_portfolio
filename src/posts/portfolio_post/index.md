This is some information about what I used to make this portfolio. It is made used Gatsby, React, and deployed with Netlify. I used a Gatsby starter project called gatsby-starter-fresh which helped with the styling of the project. The projects are side projects I've created in other repositories and turned into Gatsby pages for the portfolio. Netlify is super easy to use to deploy with Gatsby. I purchased my domain through Netlify and gave access to my repository and Netlify handles deploying every time I push to the repository.
